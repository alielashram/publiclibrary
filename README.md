# Public Library

Object-oriented Ruby was used to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library, Shelf, & Book). The library is aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf knows what books it contains. The book object has "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf the book is sitting on. The library has a method to report all books it contains.
